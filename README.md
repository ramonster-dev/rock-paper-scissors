# rock-paper-scissors
A simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Originally this started off as a pure-console implementation of the classic game, Rock, Paper, Scissors! After some time and familiarising myself more with JavaScript, I felt ready to give this game its own GUI with a spin.

In this version of RPS, you play as an adventurer and you have encountered Cakie, a legendary player within the Swords, Bows & Magic scene. If you ever want to continue in your journey, you're going to have to go through him first or die trying.
